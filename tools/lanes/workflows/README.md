# Opus workflow scripts (round 27)

The two Workflow-tool scripts that built round 27's tooling, kept as templates. Pattern: one opus implementer per
item, then one opus ADVERSARIAL reviewer that must rerun every command on the real repository and return only
demonstrated defects (schema-forced), then the implementer fixes the blocking/major ones; the session owner reviews
last and integrates. Every round-26/27 tool had a blocking defect its reviewer proved (ledger cache blind to code
changes, pool table reading one search tag, t63 dropping `volatile` invisibly to the assembly screen), so the reviewer
stage is not optional. Usage per workflow: ledger+pools 6 agents / 762k subagent tokens / 44 min; t63 3 agents /
598k tokens / 90 min (its evaluations ran inside the agents). Row-id list paths in the specs point at a session
scratchpad; regenerate them (`tools/lanes/pools.py --rows ...`) before reuse.
